Turn this purple cube into purple guy from five nights at freddy's
make him the model from the minigame
make him taller and guve him a yellow badge on the left of his chest
make his torso two pixels thinner and give hime longer limbs
give him the smile from the minigame
make his torso and limbs longer
make his idle animation look likes hes breathing
make him movable with a mouse
make it 2d
make it so you can punch him by clicking on him and make an animation for each area you punch him
shrink him a little bit
make a costom animation when you click his eye
make it look like it hurts
make the eye animation him closing the interacted eye
remove the horns the horn effect when getting hit
make it so that when you hit him with the time inbetween the hits are under 3 seconds ten times in a row he holds the area hit with any availble limb for 10 seconds
make it so when is eye is hit more than 10 times he holds it with his hand
add a dog icon and when you click on it it spawns a dog that attacks him
i dont like how when he gets hit in  the eye to the piont of holding it he only holds his chest not his eye
I want the sprite to be the image I have opened right now but just standing with the same code you can tweak it a bit to make it look smoother
yes
keep all of it
i didnt mean make the sprite the image
i meant make the image an actual sprite not make the texture the image
i wanted the sprite to acutally be a model not the picture
i want the first and i want it to be the picture but i dont want it to be the sprite but its texture is the photo i want the the sprite to be the photo with seperate legs, arms, a head, and a torso

Justin:
In this project there's a file loader button. Instead I want it to load purpleguy.png in this dir indiscriminately, no selector dialog
